# React Todo APP

This is a basic react todo app based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR6smI_YJDE.

I have added a mongo database and todo schema as well as basic routes on a server.

Currently to run the application:

  First, make sure mongo is running.

  Then, `gulp build:dev`.

  Next, `node server` and go to localhost:3000

  OR

  `webpack-dev-server` and go to localhost:8080
