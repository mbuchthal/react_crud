# React Todo APP

This is a basic react todo app based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR6smI_YJDE.

I have added a mongo database and todo schema as well as basic routes on a server.

currently to run the server, you can do one of 2 things:
  1) use'webpack-dev-server' -- and then go to localhost:8080
  2) alternatively, run 'node server', and got to port 3000, or your environment PORT
